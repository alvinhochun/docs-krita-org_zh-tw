"In Krita 3.0, we now have functionality for Grids and Guides, but of course, "
"this functionality is by itself not that interesting without snapping."

msgid ""
"Snapping is the ability to have Krita automatically align a selection or "
"shape to the grids and guides, document center and document edges. For "
"Vector layers, this goes even a step further, and we can let you snap to "
"bounding boxes, intersections, extrapolated lines and more."

"All of these can be toggled using the snap pop-up menu which is assigned to :"
"kbd:`Shift + S` shortcut."

msgid "Grids"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:26
msgid ""
"This will snap the cursor to the current grid, as configured in the grid "
"docker. This doesn’t need the grid to be visible. Grids are saved per "
"document, making this useful for aligning your art work to grids, as is the "
"case for game sprites and grid-based designs."

msgid "Pixel"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:28
msgid ""
"This allows to snap to every pixel under the cursor. Similar to Grid "
"Snapping but with a grid having spacing = 1px and offset = 0px."

msgid "Guides"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:30
msgid ""
"This allows you to snap to guides, which can be dragged out from the ruler. "
"Guides do not need to be visible for this, and are saved per document. This "
"is useful for comic panels and similar print-layouts, though we recommend "
"Scribus for more intensive work."

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:35
msgid ""
"This allows you to snap to a horizontal or vertical line from existing "
"vector objects' nodes (Unless dealing with resizing the height or width "
"only, in which case you can drag the cursor over the path). This is useful "
"for aligning object horizontally or vertically, like with comic panels."

"mathematically extended. This option allows you to snap to that. The "

"Masked brush is new feature that is only available in the :ref:"
"`pixel_brush_engine`. They are additional settings you will see in the brush "
"editor. Masked brushes allow you to combine two brush tips in one stroke. "

"good alternative to texture for creating expressive and textured brushes."

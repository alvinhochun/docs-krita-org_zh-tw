"Filters are little scripts or operations you can run on your drawing. You "
"can visualize them as real-world camera filters that can make a photo darker "
"or blurrier. Or perhaps like a coffee filter, where only water and coffee "
"gets through, and the ground coffee stays behind."

"濾鏡是一些可以套用到畫作上的指令碼或操作。你可以當它們是類似於現實中附加在相"
"機鏡頭上的濾鏡，能夠把相片變得暗淡或模糊。又或許像咖啡過濾紙一樣，只容許水和"
"咖啡通過，而咖啡豆則停留在上方。"

"Filters are unique to digital painting in terms of complexity, and their "
"part of the painting pipeline. Some artists only use filters to adjust their "
"colors a little. Others, using Filter Layers and Filter Masks use them to "
"dynamically update a part of an image to be filtered. This way, they can "
"keep the original underneath without changing the original image. This is a "
"part of a technique called 'non-destructive' editing."

"濾鏡對於數位繪圖而言，其複雜程度，和在工作流程中所佔的位置，都是有點獨特的。"
"有些畫家只會用濾鏡為畫作稍微調校一下色彩，有些則會利用濾鏡圖層和濾鏡遮罩，以"
"不改變原圖、可以保留本來圖像的方式，動態地更新圖像的一部份。後面這種技巧稱為"
"「非破壞性編輯」。"

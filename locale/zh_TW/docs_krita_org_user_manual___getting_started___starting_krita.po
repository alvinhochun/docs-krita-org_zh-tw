"existing document. To create a new canvas you have to create a new document "
"from the :guilabel:`File` menu or by clicking on :guilabel:`New File`  under "
"start section of the welcome screen. This will open the new file dialog box. "
"If you want to open an existing image, either use :menuselection:`File --> "

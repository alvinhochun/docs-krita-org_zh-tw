"Local Selection masks let you remember and recall edit a selection on a "
"layer. They work in a similar way to extra channels in other image editing "
"programs. One difference is :program:`Krita's` ability to assign them to "
"specific layers and activate a selection with a single click on the layer. "
"Just click the round icon with the dotted outline on the local selection "
"layer in the Layers docker."

"局部選取區域可以記住或說留下編輯圖層上的選取區域。 其工作方式和其他影像編輯軟體中額外的通道很類似。 差異是 :program:`Krita's` "
"能夠把這些選取紀錄分配到特定圖層，並利用點擊該選取圖層的功能圖示來再次執行選擇。 "
"很簡單點擊圖層工作介面中局部選取區域圖層右邊有個虛線輪廓的圓形圖示就可以了 ( 小技巧 : 也可以按著 ctrl 鍵點擊該圖層 )。"

"A single layer can contain multiple Local Selection Masks. Repeating. A "
"single layer can contain multiple Local Selection Masks (LSM). This is "
"important because it means that you can, for instance, have several "
"different outline parts of an image and save each as its own LSM and then "
"recall it with a single click. Without using LSM you would have to create "
"layer upon layer for each mask. Not only would this be inefficient for you "
"but also for Krita and the program would slow down trying to keep up with it "
"all. LSM's are one of the most important features in Krita!"

"Selection Mask`. The global selection, if you have anything selected, will "
"now appear on the top of the layer stack as a selection mask."

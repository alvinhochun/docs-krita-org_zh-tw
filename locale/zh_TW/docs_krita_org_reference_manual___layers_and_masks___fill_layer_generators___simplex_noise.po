"This fills the layer with generated OpenSimplex noise. OpenSimplex is "
"different from the more common Perlin noise (often named 'clouds' in other "
"software) and also different from Improved Perlin noise. OpenSimplex has "
"less dimensional artifacts (the subtle \"checker\" texture often found high "
"frequency Perlin noise) and is a ubiquitous open standard. Since OpenSimplex "
"noise is important to texture generation, this fill layer has the option to "
"loop around the canvas edge. You can read more about OpenSimplex `here "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimplex_noise>`_."

"There are a few different use cases for simplex noise. One of these is to "
"create interesting looping patterns, achieved by stacking multiple simplex "
"noise fills with different blending modes. It becomes even more expressive "
"when combined with the levels adjustment layers. For texture artists, this "
"can be a useful utility when combined with a gradient map filter layer to "
"provide color diversity to a looping texture. For traditional artists, "
"simplex noise layers can be converted to selection masks to create brush "
"transparency dynamics and masking effects. Experimenting with different "
"combinations can be fun and produce interesting results!"

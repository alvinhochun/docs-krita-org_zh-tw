"While working on complex artwork you'll often find the need to group some "
"layers or portions and elements of the artwork as one unit. Group layers "
"come in handy for this: They allow you to segregate some layers so you can "
"hide these quickly, or so you can recursively transform the content of the "
"group, or so you can apply a mask to all the layers inside this group as if "
"they are one (e.g. by dragging an existing mask to to a group layer), etc.. "
"You can quickly create a group layer by selecting the layers that should be "
"grouped together and then pressing the :kbd:`Ctrl + G` shortcut."

"A thing to note is that the layers inside a group layer are considered "
"separately from the outside when the group layer gets composited: All layers "
"inside are combined first, and then this intermediate result is used on the "
"outside for compositing the rest of the image. In Photoshop on the contrary, "
"groups have something called pass-through mode which makes the layers behave "
"as if they are not in a group and get composited along with other layers of "
"the stack. Recent versions of Krita offer a pass-through mode as well, which "
"can be enabled in order to get similar behavior."

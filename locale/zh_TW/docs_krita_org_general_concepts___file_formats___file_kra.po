"``.kra`` is Krita's internal file-format, which means that it is the file "
"format that saves all of the features Krita can handle. It's construction is "
"vaguely based on the open document standard, which means that you can rename "
"your ``.kra`` file to a ``.zip`` file and open it up to look at the insides. "
"In Krita's settings dialog you can enable compression; with compression "
"enabled the files will be smaller, but saving will take longer."

"A ``.kra`` file contains a file names ``mergedimage.png`` which is contains "
"the rendered image as you see it on your canvas. Some applications, like "
"Scribus, can use the ``mergedimage.png`` file to open ``.kra`` files. This "
"file is always in the RGBA color model, or grayscale for files that are "
"originally grayscale."

"The ``.krz`` file format is a ``.kra`` file without ``mergedimage.png`` and "
"with compression always enabled. You can use this format if you want to save "
"disk space and do not care about interchange with those applications that "
"load the ``mergedimage.png`` file."

"``.tiff``, or Tagged Image File Format, is a raster interchange format that "
"was originally designed to be a common format generated by scanners and used "
"by printers."

"If build with :program:`libtiff 4.2` or later, :program:`Krita` can open and "
"save :program:`Photoshop` style layered ``.tiff``. These are different from "
"regular layered ``.tiff``, as :program:`Photoshop` stores :ref:`file_psd` "
"data inside the ``.tiff``. This means things like layerstyles and blending "
"modes can be stored and read by :program:`Photoshop`, but not every software "
"that can open layered ``.tiff`` will be able to open these."

"As an interchange format, ``.tiff`` is not meant for sharing on the "
"internet, and you will not find many websites that do accept it. However, "
"printhouses know the file format, and will likely accept it."

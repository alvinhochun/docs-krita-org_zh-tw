"Krita's interface is very flexible and provides an ample choice for the "
"artists to arrange the elements of the workspace. An artist can snap and "
"arrange the elements, much like snapping together Lego blocks. Krita "
"provides a set of construction kit parts in the form of Dockers and "
"Toolbars. Every set of elements can be shown, hidden, moved and rearranged "
"that let the artists easily customize their own user interface experience."

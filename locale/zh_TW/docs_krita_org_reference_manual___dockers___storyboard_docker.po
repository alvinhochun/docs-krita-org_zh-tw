"A storyboard is a series of drawings and directions that outlines a film as "
"a set of scenes. These scenes may be accompanied with text that can provide "
"additional context such as dialog, action descriptions, or pertinent details "
"needed for production. Storyboarding is used extensively during the planning "
"phase of a film to achieve a better understanding of the overall production "
"and its needs. Storyboards are also useful for teams to discuss the scene-by-"
"scene flow of a film or make any necessary changes before entering the "
"production phase."

"Krita's Storyboard Docker allows the user to develop a story by creating and "
"managing scenes. This includes the addition, removal, or adjustment of a "
"scene. Users can also insert additional scenes between other scenes when "
"necessary, or reorder scenes via drag-and-drop. The storyboard's visual "
"content exists within Krita's internal animation system, which gives users "
"the ability to preview the sequence using the Animation Timeline's transport "
"controls. The storyboard docker also supports exporting the contents of a "
"storyboard to a document. The current supported formats for export are `SVG` "
"and `PDF`."

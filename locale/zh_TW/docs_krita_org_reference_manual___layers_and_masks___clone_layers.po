"cannot draw or paint on it directly, but it can be used to create effects by "

"You can change the source of one or more Clone Layers in the Layers Docker. "
"To do so, select one or more Clone Layers in the docker (hold :kbd:`Ctrl` "
"or :kbd:`Shift` and left-click the layers). Then, right-click on any "
"selected layer. In the context menu, there is an action named :guilabel:`Set "
"Copy From`. Click it. A dialog will pop up and there is a drop-down menu "
"with all possible layers to be set as the source of all selected Clone "
"Layers. If the current source of them consists of multiple layers, the "
"default activated selection in the drop-down menu will be blank. Otherwise, "

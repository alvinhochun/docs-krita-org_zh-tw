"Apparently, the Bristle brush engine is derived from this brush engine. Now, "
"all of :program:`Krita's` brushes have a great variety of uses, so you must "
"have tried out the Chalk brush and wondered what it is for. Is it nothing "
"but a pixel brush with opacity and saturation fade options? As per the "
"developers this brush uses a different algorithm than the Pixel Brush, and "
"they left it in here as a simple demonstration of the capabilities of :"
"program:`Krita's` brush engines."

"顯然，鬃毛筆刷就是源自這款筆刷引擎。現在，所有Krita的畫筆都有各種各樣的用途，"

"選項的像素畫筆嗎？根據開發者的說法，這個畫筆使用了與 畫素筆刷不同的算法，他們"
"把它留在這裡作為Krita畫筆引擎功能的簡單演示。"

"Yeah, that's it, a round brush with some chalky texture, and the option to "

"是的，就是這樣，一個帶有一些粉刷紋理的圓形刷子，以及淡化不透明度和飽和度的選"

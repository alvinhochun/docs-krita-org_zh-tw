"Krita doesn't have clipping mask functionality in the manner that Photoshop "
"and programs that mimic Photoshop's functionality have. That's because in "
"Krita, unlike such software, a group layer is not an arbitrary collection of "
"layers. Rather, in Krita, group layers are composited separately from the "
"rest of the stack, and then the result is added into the stack. In other "
"words, in Krita group layers are in effect distinct images inside your image."

"Here we have an image with line art and a layer for each flat of colors. We "
"want to add complicated multi-layered shading to this, while keeping the "
"neatness of the existing color flats. To get a clipping mask working, you "
"first need to put layers into a group. You can do this by making a group "
"layer and drag-and-dropping the layers into it, or by selecting the layers "
"you want grouped and pressing the :kbd:`Ctrl + G` shortcut. Here we do that "
"with the iris and the eye-white layers."

"Now there’s an easier way to set up alpha inheritance. If you select a layer "

"set with alpha inheritance is added on top."

"The fact that alpha inheritance can use the composited transparency from a "

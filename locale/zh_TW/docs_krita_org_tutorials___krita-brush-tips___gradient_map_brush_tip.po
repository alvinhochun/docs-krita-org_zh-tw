"Gradient mapped tips work much in the same way as the gradient map filter "
"does: The grey-values of each pixel in the brush is mapped to the gradient "
"color. As gradients can have some of their colors be assigned to be the fore "
"or background color, you can effectively make dual-loaded brush tips this "
"way."

"If we imagine a continuous color gradient mapping to a grayscale gradient, "
"we can imagine how grayscale colors can be transformed to the colors of the "
"gradient. This is called gradient mapping, because you are mapping a "
"grayscale to a gradient."

msgid "Krita is a great place to start even if you are brand new to KDE development. We'd love to have you join! You'll be able to work on one of the coolest and fastest-growing open source painting programs out there. Krita also benefits from a modular architecture and the use of the KDE Frameworks and Qt libraries, which makes it easier to focus on new features instead of reinventing the wheel. And it makes coding fun! To work on Krita, you have to use C++ and Qt. It's a good way to learn both, actually!"

Join us on ``#krita on Libera.Chat`` (keep in mind that most people are in Europe or India) and just ask your question. Stay around, especially if you don't get an answer immediately.

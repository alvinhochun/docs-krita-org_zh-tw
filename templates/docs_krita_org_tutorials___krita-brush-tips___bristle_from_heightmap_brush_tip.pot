msgid "When looking at oil paintings, especially the impressionistic ones, it is hard not to be in awe of the effect the visible brush strokes have on the the painting. While a digital painting program is a fundamentally different medium from the oil paint one, we can utilize some tricks to get visible brush strokes."

msgid "The simplest way to get a visible brush stroke is to select a :ref:`predefined brush <predefined_brush_tip>`. If you select one with several separate dots, and lower the spacing to 0.02, you can get a sort of brush stroke effect. But we can do better, for example, how about a brush which gives more coverage, the harder you press?"

msgid "We can achieve that effect with the sharpness option. Consider the following brush tip. We've used the gradient tool to draw two concentric foreground-to-transparent gradients side by side on a white-filled layer. Then we used the elliptical selection tool with :menuselection:`Edit --> Copy Merged` to cut out an ellipse shape, and then used the clipboard option in the predfined brush chooser to create a new brush."

Eventually you should have each layer have less coverage that the one above that. Now, go to the predefined brushes tab, and select :guilabel:`Stamp`.

msgid "We’re always working on the next version of Krita. We fix bugs and implement new features. Every change to any software comes with a risk of introducing other issues. That's where testing comes in. The tester’s job is to uncover defects as early as possible in the development process: a bug caught early enough means easier fixing, better user experience and less load on user support."

msgid "While the other layers of the test suite are composed of carefully curated scripted tests, balancing between coverage and efficiency, exploratory testing approaches testing quite differently. It’s purpose is to allow humans to apply their unique tools: learning, creativity, intuition. There are no suites, scenarios, defined steps. Just you and Krita. Explore and experiment. Try basic workflows. Try unexpected combinations. Try to break things. Then report bugs."

From that collection we create a survey on survey.kde.org and publicly release the beta version. Link to the survey is available on the welcome page of the beta release."

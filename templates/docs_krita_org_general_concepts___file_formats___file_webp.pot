msgid "WebP is a file format based on the `RIFF container specification <https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/riff_container>`_ that, like :ref:`file_heif`, it builds upon a video codec (`VP8 <https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/compression#lossy_webp>`_) to support :ref:`lossy_compression`. WebP tends to be largely used for websites, though not all websites support uploading such files. If you self-host you can investigate whether WebP is an improvement over :ref:`file_jpeg` or :ref:`file_png`. However, it is not very widely supported by image editors, so if you are doing collaboration with other artists, it may be better to use a different file format."

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats/file_webp.rst:24
msgid "Instead of making you responsible for the precise settings, the WebP exporter will try out different techniques to compress better. You give a goal (a given quality or a certain file size) to aim for, and it will try its best to reach that goal. To do this, it may actually try to redo a given step of the encoding process several times. In the end, what you will have to choose is whether you want a high quality result at the cost of a slow export, or a quick export at the cost of quality."

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats/file_webp.rst:36
msgid "With :guilabel:`Lossless Compression`, 0% means the library will use the fewest amount of algorithmic tricks to reduce file size. This means fast saving times, at the expense of larger files. Conversely, 100% means all algorithmic tricks will be used, leading to the smallest file size, but saving will take longer. The first is best for a situation where speed is more important than size, such as files you share via USB. The latter is useful for situations where the file size can become a problem, such as serving it over the Internet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/file_formats/file_webp.rst:38
msgid "Without :guilabel:`Lossless Compression`, image information considered redundant will be removed, rather than compressed. This means that at 0%, the most information wll be lost and thus the smallest file size is achieved. This also reduces the overall quality. Conversely, 100% will remove the least amount of image information and thus maintain quality at the expense of a large file size."

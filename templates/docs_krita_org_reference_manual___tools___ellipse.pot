msgid "Use this tool to paint an ellipse. The currently selected brush is used for drawing the ellipse outline. Click and hold the left mouse button to indicate one corner of the ‘bounding rectangle’ of the ellipse, then move your mouse to the opposite corner. :program:`Krita` will show a preview of the ellipse using a thin line. Release the button to draw the ellipse."

msgid "You can change between the corner/corner and center/corner dragging methods as often as you want by holding down or releasing the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, provided you keep the left mouse button pressed. With the :kbd:`Ctrl` key pressed, mouse movements will affect all four corners of the bounding rectangle (relative to the center), without the :kbd:`Ctrl` key, the corner opposite to the one you are moving remains still. With the :kbd:`Alt` key pressed, all four corners will be affected, but the size stays the same."

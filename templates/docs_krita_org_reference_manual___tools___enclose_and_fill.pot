msgid "Besides choosing how to create an enclosing area, it is also possible to choose which found regions will be filled. Krita can differentiate between the color (or lack thereof) of a region as well as the colors it is surrounded by. For some of these options a specific color needs to be selected, and thus a color selection button is shown. The :guilabel:`Region Extent` options control how precise a given color should match this selected color."

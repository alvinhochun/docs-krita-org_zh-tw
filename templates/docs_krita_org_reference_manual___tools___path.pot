msgid "With an intermediate control point (i.e. a point that is not the starting point and not the ending point), you can move the direction handles separately to have the curve enter and leave the point in different directions. After editing a point, you can just click on the canvas to continue adding points to the curve. When creating a path on a vector layer, the resulting path can be further edited with the :ref:`shape_edit_tool`."

msgid "The clone brush is a brush engine that allows you to paint with a duplication of a section of a paint-layer. This is useful in manipulation of photos and textures. You have to select a source and then you can paint to copy or clone the source to a different area. Other applications normally have a separate tool for this, Krita has a brush engine for this."

msgid "The middle section contains a few properties that change how the Color Sampler picks up color; you can set a :guilabel:`Radius`, which will average the colors in the area around the cursor, and you can now also set a :guilabel:`Blend` percentage, which controls how much color is \"soaked up\" and mixed in with your current color. Read :ref:`mixing_colors` for information about how the Color Sampler's blend option can be used as a tool for off-canvas color mixing."

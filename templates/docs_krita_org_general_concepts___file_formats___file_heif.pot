msgid "The High Efficiency Image Format (``*.heif``, ``*.heic``), and it's cousin, AV1 Image Format (``*.avif``) are formats which use video codecs (``H264``, ``H265`` and ``AV1``) to store their data. They are more and more popular with mobile phones as their default image file format, and ``*.avif`` is to be natively supported by all web browsers within the next few years."

msgid "Krita supports saving :ref:`model_gray` and :ref:`model_rgb` images to these formats. Furthermore, it can save 8 bit, will save 16 bit integer as 12 bit, and can save 16 and 32 bit float as 12 bit, with an HDR color space."

msgid "Compared to :ref:`file_png` and :ref:`file_jpeg`, these formats tend to smooth out textures to make them easier to compress, and therefore great for sharp images with a lot of smooth gradients. Images with a lot of texture or fine details may lose said detail (for example, cat whiskers seem to get lost), and thus :ref:`file_jpeg` might be better suited."

msgid "However, Hybrid Log Gamma needs an extra conversion step inbetween, as Krita currently does not support sending HLG data to the display. For this :dfn:`Scene Linear to Display Linear` conversion, it would need to know your :dfn:`display gamma` and :dfn:`maximum brightness`. The default brightness and gamma values are the ones used for a HLG to PQ conversion, and probably your best bet when your monitor is able to display Krita's HDR. When exporting this image with HLG, it's recommended to reuse the same values for the reverse OOTF there."

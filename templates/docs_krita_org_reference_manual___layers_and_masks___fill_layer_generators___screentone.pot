msgid "Because this filter needs to align the :term:`screen<Screen>` image to the :term:`pixel grid<Pixel Grid>` (the rasterization process) it may happen that not all the :term:`cells<Screen Cell>` contain exactly the same shape (in terms of pixel values). This can produce artifacts such as moire patterns. To solve this, the :term:`screen grid<Screen Grid>` can be aligned to the pixel grid in such a way that some screen cell corners fall at integer pixel coordinates. You can select every how many screen cells horizontally and vertically this should happen. The effect is that the shapes of the set of cells between such aligned corners will repeat. For example, if you align the screen grid every 2 cells horizontally and every 1 cell vertically, every 2 by 1 block of cells will be identical (although the cells inside the block can be slightly different with respect to each other). This set of contiguous cells that repeat along the screen is sometimes called a :dfn:`macrocell` or :dfn:`supercell`. Similarly the single cell is sometimes called :dfn:`microcell`."

msgid "The :term:`spot functions<Spot Function>` are simple periodic 2D functions that output a value between black and white. Every one cycle in the width and height forms a :term:`screentone cell<Screen Cell>` and all the cells combined form the :term:`screentone grid<Screen Grid>`. The spot functions are designed to be simple and fast to compute, but for some functions this means that they don't have a uniform distribution of values. Suppose we threshold the function (contrast value equal to 100%, the usual in traditional halftoning). This lack of uniform distribution has the downside of not producing shapes that have a direct relationship between the brightness of the input and the coverage of the black areas. The effect is a mismatch between the input brightness and the perceived brightness. If the function has a uniform distribution of values, for example choosing a brightness of 40% will produce a shape that has 40% of the pixels *white* and 60% *black*. To solve this the user can select between three equalization modes:"

msgid ":guilabel:`Template based equalization`: this mode is a bit more involved. It tries to replicate the traditional :term:`screen<Screen>` generation methods on digital halftoning. This achieves equalization in a very different way. First the original :term:`spot function<Spot Function>` is used along with the transformation parameters to create a template (a small image) that contains a set of one or more contiguous :term:`cells<Screen Cell>` (:term:`macrocell<Macrocell>`) and is used as a reference later to paint the :term:`screentone grid<Screen Grid>`. To equalize the template, all the pixels in the macrocell are then sorted from darker to lighter over all the macrocells and from top-left to bottom-right over each cell. This step will produce an equalized macrocell that grows 1 pixel at a time (or a bit more if the number of pixels in it is greater than 256), avoiding the sudden jumps in brightness."

If you use linear interpolation the dots will look as black circles/ellipses that grow radially until they cover the :term:`cells<Screen Cell>`. If you use the sinusoidal interpolation, the round/elliptical dot pattern will change *symmetrically*. This means that at low brightness values the pattern will look as small white circles/ellipses and at high brightness values it will look as small black circles/ellipses. At mid-brightness values the pattern will look as a checkerboard."

msgid "Krita's brush editor is, as you may know, on the :kbd:`F5` key. However, sometimes you just want to modify a single parameter quickly. Perhaps even in canvas-only mode. The on canvas brush editor or brush HUD allows you to do this. It's accessible from the pop-up palette, by ticking the lower-right arrow button."

The :guilabel:`Up` and :guilabel:`Down` buttons allow you to adjust the order of the used settings, for when you think flow is more important than size."

msgid "When you are not sure about whether what you did is correct. It is common within the Krita community that even developers with commit access will have a weaning period in which they still make merge requests for each change as they're getting comfortable with the codebase. It is not mandatory to do so at this point, but requests are the best way for us to help one another with writing good code."

While some requests require specialist knowledge, these items are so universal that anyone who knows how to check them can do so and comment on them.

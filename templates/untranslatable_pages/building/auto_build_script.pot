msgid "The building script lies at `https://github.com/tusooa/scripts/blob/servant/bin/krita-build.perl <https://github.com/tusooa/scripts/blob/servant/bin/krita-build.perl>`_. To run this script you will need a Perl interpreter. If you do not have one yet on your computer, one simple way is to install it through `MSys <https://www.msys2.org/>`_. Msys is not needed for the building process. If you are using the Msys installer, it is advised to install MinGW with it. If you do not want to install Msys, you can just install `MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_."

msgid "The `CMake <https://www.cmake.org>`_ build system generators used by Krita is one of the most used build system generators in the C++ world. A build system is a system that describes how an application should be built from source code. CMake generates a build system from the information given in the CMakeLists.txt and `*.cmake` files. It is a complete but rather unusual language."

If set to OFF, Krita will popup a little message window telling you about the error, of OFF, it will print the information to the terminal. For developers, either is fine, at least, if you start Krita and pay attention to the terminal output. For packagers, it should be ON."

"The `halftone <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone>`_ filter tries to "

msgid ""
"With this option the halftoning is applied only to the alpha channel (you "

msgid ""
"When the selected mode is *Independent Channels*, multiple tabs for the "
"different channels appear to let the user choose different options for each "
"one; otherwise no tabs for the channels appear and there is only one set of "
"options. The halftoning process works by making a pattern image (commonly "
"named *screen*) that is combined with the original image in a specific way."

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/filters/artistic.rst:40
msgid ""
"The filter uses the *fill layer generators* to create the screen (pattern) "
"image instead of using a predefined set of patterns and options. This way "
"the range of possible results can grow as new generators are added to Krita. "
"Also the user can make his own patterns by using the pattern generator and "
"custom pattern images. For more information see :ref:`this page on fill "
"layer generators and their options <fill_layers>`."

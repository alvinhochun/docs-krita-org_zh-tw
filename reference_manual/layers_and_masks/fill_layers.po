"By default, the dialog selects the flat color fill. This fills the layer "
"with a singular color. Newly created colored fill layers will be assigned to "
"the currently active foreground color, unless they were made by drag-and-"
"dropping a :ref:`palette swatch <palette_docker>` onto the :ref:`layer stack "
"<layer_docker>`."

"A fill-layer is a single-channel layer, meaning it only has transparency. "
"Therefore, you can erase and paint on fill-layers to make them semi-opaque, "
"or for when you want to have a particular color only. Being single channel, "
"fill-layers are also a little bit less memory-consuming than regular 4-"
"channel paint layers."

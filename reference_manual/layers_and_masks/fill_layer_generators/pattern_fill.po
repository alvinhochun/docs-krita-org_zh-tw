"This fills the layer with a predefined pattern or texture that has been "
"loaded into Krita through the Resource Management interface. Patterns can be "
"a simple and interesting way to add texture to your drawing or painting, "
"helping to recreate the look of watercolor paper, linen, canvas, hardboard, "
"stone or an infinite other number of options. For example if you want to "
"take a digital painting and finish it off with the appearance of it being on "
"canvas you can add a Fill Layer with the Canvas texture from the texture "
"pack below and set the opacity very low so the \"threads\" of the pattern "
"are just barley visible.  The effect is quite convincing."

"You can create your own and use those as well.  For a great set of well "
"designed and useful patterns check out one of our favorite artists and a "
"great friend of Krita, David Revoy's free texture pack (https://www."
"davidrevoy.com/article156/texture-pack-1)."

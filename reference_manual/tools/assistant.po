"Create, edit, and remove drawing assistants on the canvas. There are a "
"number of different assistants that can be used from this tool. The tool "
"options allow you to add new assistants, and to save/load assistants. To add "
"a new assistant, select a type from the tool options and begin clicking on "
"the canvas. Each assistant is created a bit differently. There are also "
"additional controls on existing assistants that allow you to move and delete "
"them."

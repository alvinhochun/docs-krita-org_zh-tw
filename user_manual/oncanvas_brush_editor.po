"Krita's brush editor is, as you may know, on the :kbd:`F5` key. However, "
"sometimes you just want to modify a single parameter quickly. Perhaps even "
"in canvas-only mode. The on canvas brush editor or brush HUD allows you to "
"do this. It's accessible from the pop-up palette, by ticking the lower-right "
"arrow button."

"On the left are all unused settings, on the right are all used settings. You "
"use the :guilabel:`>` and :guilabel:`<` buttons to move a setting between "
"the two columns. The :guilabel:`Up` and :guilabel:`Down` buttons allow you "
"to adjust the order of the used settings, for when you think flow is more "
"important than size."
